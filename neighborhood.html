My neighborhood is right next to my high school. You could seriously throw a rock at my high school from my house.
There is also a park within my neighborhood. It is called prospector park.
My neighborhood has around 100 houses in it. There is also a brand new neighborhood right next to mine.
There are about 20 houses on the street we live on. That street is sort of an "L" shape. We live on the corner of the "L" shape.
